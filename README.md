## About

These are my dot files. 

## Linux Quickstart

Checkout the source to ~/dotFiles. To create symlinks just run the makeSymlinks.sh script. 

## Windows Quickstart

Checkout the source code to ~/dotfiles/. Create a .vimrc in your home directory with the text:
	source $HOME\dotfiles\.vimrc

## Notes

By default swap files and backups are placed in the system temporary directory (/var/tmp or $TEMP). This may be an issue for you on multiuser systems when editing sensitive files.
