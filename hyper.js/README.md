# hyper.js

[hyper.js](https://github.com/zeit/hyper) terminal configuration. It's slow on Windows. Neovim integration isn't there yet. Still, it's an interesting terminal.

## Setup

Install hyper.js using Chocolatey on Windows: `choco install hyper -y`.

Run the following Powershell from your dotfiles root:

```ps1
provision/Set-DotfilesSymlinks.ps1
```
